    • Couldn't match type: w0 -> A w0
                     with: A a
      Expected: a -> A a
        Actual: a -> w0 -> A w0
    • Probable cause: ‘pure’ is applied to too few arguments
      In the expression: pure @(_ -> WrappedMonad A _) @(_ -> A _) pure
      In an equation for ‘pure’:
          pure = pure @(_ -> WrappedMonad A _) @(_ -> A _) pure
      In the instance declaration for ‘Applicative A’
    • Relevant bindings include
        pure :: a -> A a (bound at T13819.hs:12:3)
