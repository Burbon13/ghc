Note [Migrating TcM Messages]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of #18516, we are slowly migrating the diagnostic messages emitted
and reported in the TcM from SDoc to TcRnMessage. Historically, GHC emitted
some diagnostics in 3 pieces, i.e. there were lots of error-reporting functions
that accepted 3 SDocs an input: one for the important part of the message,
one for the context and one for any supplementary information. Consider the following:

    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Int’ with actual type ‘Char’
    • In the expression: x4
      In a stmt of a 'do' block: return (x2, x4)
      In the expression:

Under the hood, the reporting functions in Tc.Utils.Monad were emitting "Couldn't match"
as the important part, "In the expression" as the context and "In a stmt..In the expression"
as the supplementary, with the context and supplementary usually smashed together so that
the final message would be composed only by two SDoc (which would then be bulletted like in
the example).

In order for us to smooth out the migration to the new diagnostic infrastructure, we
introduce the 'ErrInfo' and 'TcRnMessageDetailed' types, which serve exactly the purpose
of bridging the two worlds together without breaking the external API or the existing
format of messages reported by GHC.

Using 'ErrInfo' and 'TcRnMessageDetailed' also allows us to move away from the SDoc-ridden
diagnostic API inside Tc.Utils.Monad, enabling further refactorings.

In the future, once the conversion will be complete and we will successfully eradicate
any use of SDoc in the diagnostic reporting of GHC, we can surely revisit the usage and
existence of these two types, which for now remain a "necessary evil".

  {-| TcRnMonomorphicBindings is a warning (controlled by -Wmonomorphism-restriction)

        bar = 10

      The example above emits the warning (for 'bar'), because without monomorphism
      restriction the inferred type for 'bar' is 'bar :: Num p => p'. This warning tells us
      that /if/ we were to enable '-XMonomorphismRestriction' we would make 'bar'
      less polymorphic, as its type would become 'bar :: Int', so GHC warns us about that.
